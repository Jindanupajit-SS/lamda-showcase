 Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?

ZonedDateTime birthday =
       ZonedDateTime.ofLocal(
               LocalDateTime.of(
              /* year */ 1978,  /* month */  6,  /*  day */  9, /* hour */ 17,  /*  min */ 5, /* sec */ 12,  /* nano */204)

            , /* time zone */ ZoneId.of("Asia/Bangkok"), /* offset (preferred) */  null);




 Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?

zonedDateTime.with(TemporalAdjusters.previous(DayOfWeek.THURSDAY));



 What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?

ZoneId is to specific the geolocation which have different rules to calculate time including daylight saving, but ZoneOffset is to specific the constant offset from UTC time.



 How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?

// instant to ZonedDateTime
instant.atZone(ZoneId.of("Z"));

// ZonedDateTime to instant
zonedDateTime.toInstant();




 Write an example that, for a given year, reports the length of each month within that year.


Year year = Year.of(2020);

Map<Month, Integer> monthLength = Arrays.stream(Month.values())
       .collect(Collectors.toMap(Function.identity(), m->year.atMonth(m).atEndOfMonth().getDayOfMonth()));

monthLength.keySet().stream().sorted().forEach((m) -> System.out.printf("%s %d\n", m, monthLength.get(m)));




 Write an example that, for a given month of the current year, lists all of the Mondays in that month.

Month m = Month.FEBRUARY;
YearMonth yearMonth = Year.now().atMonth(m);

for (int day = 1; day <= yearMonth.atEndOfMonth().getDayOfMonth(); day++) {
   LocalDate date;
   if ( DayOfWeek.MONDAY.equals((date = yearMonth.atDay(day)).getDayOfWeek()) )
       System.out.printf("MONDAY %s\n",date.toString());
}




 Write an example that tests whether a given date occurs on Friday the 13th.

LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();

if (date.getDayOfMonth() == 13 &&  DayOfWeek.FRIDAY.equals(date.getDayOfWeek()))
   System.out.printf("%s is FRIDAY 13th.", date.toString());
else
   System.out.printf("%s is NOT FRIDAY 13th.", date.toString());
